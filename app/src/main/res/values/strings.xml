        Please note that SMS rates will be charged by your mobile network provider, and the app will NOT limit the
        amount of messages sent. We enforce fair usage, but ultimately, your mobile network provider may decide to block

        is against their Terms of Service.

        By pressing accept, you free us of any responsibility inherited from the messages sent from this application,
        and acknowledge the need of SMS permissions for the app to perform its core functionalities.
